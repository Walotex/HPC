We need to compute 𝜋 via numerical integration. We use the fact that 𝜋 is the area of the unit circle, and we approximate this by computing the área of a quarter circle using Riemann sums. In this repository you will find the scripts used to achieve this by using 3 methods
* Pure Python
* Multiprocess
* Mpi4Py
